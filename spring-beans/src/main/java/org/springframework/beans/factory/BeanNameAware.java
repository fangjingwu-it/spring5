/**
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that want to be aware of their
 * bean name in a bean factory. Note that it is not usually recommended
 * that an object depends on its bean name, as this represents a potentially
 * brittle dependence on external configuration, as well as a possibly
 * unnecessary dependence on a Spring API.
 *
 * <p>For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the
 * {@link BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.

 *
 * 扩展点之五：BeanNameAware-如果某个bean需要访问配置文件中本身bean的id属性，这个Bean类通过实现该接口（在依赖关系确定之后，且在调用任何生命周期回调之前）
 *    提供回调自身的能力，从而获得本身bean的id属性，该接口提供了void setBeanName(String name)方法实现，
 * 使用场景：其实现大多仅仅是一行代码，即将容器获取的值，set到我们声明的类中的一个字段上。供以后使用：当需要提高日志的的质量时可以使用它

	 * Set the name of the bean in the bean factory that created this bean.
	 * <p>Invoked after population of normal bean properties but before an
	 * init callback such as {@link InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet()}
	 * or a custom init-method.
	 * @param name the name of the bean in the factory.
	 * Note that this name is the actual bean name used in the factory, which may
	 * differ from the originally specified name: in particular for inner bean
	 * names, the actual bean name might have been made unique through appending
	 * "#..." suffixes. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils#originalBeanName(String)}
	 * method to extract the original bean name (without suffix), if desired.
	 *
	 * name参数就是该bean的id属性，加调该setBeanName方法可以让bean获取得自身的id属性
