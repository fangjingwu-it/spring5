/**
 * Allows for custom modification of an application context's bean definitions,
 * adapting the bean property values of the context's underlying bean factory.
 *
 * <p>Application contexts can auto-detect BeanFactoryPostProcessor beans in
 * their bean definitions and apply them before any other beans get created.
 *
 * <p>Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that
 * override bean properties configured in the application context.
 *
 * <p>See PropertyResourceConfigurer and its concrete implementations
 * for out-of-the-box solutions that address such configuration needs.
 *
 * <p>A BeanFactoryPostProcessor may interact with and modify bean
 * definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean
 * instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects.
 * If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing
 * {@link BeanPostProcessor} instead.

 * 扩展点之十二：BeanFactoryPostProcessor（和BeanPostProcessor相似，可以对bean的定义，即配置元素进行处理）-工厂（容器）级生命周期接口方法。
 *    任何其他的Bean实例化之前被调用，读取配置元数据，并可以修改他们
 * 典型应用是：其子类实现PropertyPlaceholderConfigure这个bean，可以用来指定要引入的属性配置文件xxx.properties
